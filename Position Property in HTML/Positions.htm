    <div class="info">
        <p>By default the position of boxes is static --&gt; with this position applied we can't apply left right top
            bottom and z-index properties.</p> <br>
        <p>By choosing the position as relative --&gt; we can shift the box from top bottom left right reltive to it's
            original position , now as box 2 is overlapping box 1 and if we want our box1 to overlap box2 then we use
            z-index Property.</p> <br>
        <p>By choosing position as absolute for box1--&gt; div box 1 which is under div.parent with position absolute
            and top 0px will check it's parent element i.e div.parent is positioned element or not (means it have
            position other than static or not) if not then it will move to body which is the parent for div.parent to
            check whether it's positioned or not , if not then it will move to html tag which is the parent for body and
            if not then HTML is not a child element of any one then it will adjust relative to HTML element. "so the
            position:absolute; will be applied relative to nearest positioned element." . But if the parent element i.e
            div.parent is positioned then the box 1 will be positioned relative to div.parent. If transform , filter or
            perspective properties are used then they can also make an element appear positioned.</p> <br>
        <p> By choosing position as fixed --&gt; if we set the position of the element as fixed and set top bottom left
            right values then it will get fixed at that place it will not move anywhere even if we scroll the page. Just
            like the bottom ad's in the websites.</p> <br>
        <p>By choosing the position as sticky --&gt; the box whose position is sticky will get stick to that position
            when we scroll the page. Useful for creating "Navbars"</p>
