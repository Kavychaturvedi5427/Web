    <h1>What are Semantic Tags?</h1>
    <p> Semantic Tags are used to tell browsers and web crawlers about your website. They tells developers and web
        browsers that what kind of content is being presented in the website.
        Here are some of the key semantic tags you must know about:

        <li>article: Indicates a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.</li>
        <li>section: Represents a thematic grouping of content on a web page.</li>
        <li>aside: Typically used for sidebars or content that is tangentially related to the main content.</li>
        <li>footer: Represents the footer of a web page, usually containing copyright information and contact details.
