    <h1>What are HTML Entities?</h1>
    <p>HTML Entities are used to represent special characters in a way that the browser can understand . They begins
        with ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). </p>
    <h2>Why use HTML Entities?</h2>
    <p>They are generally used to write those thing which might collide with HTML syntax. Here are some reasons to use
        HTML Entities :-
    <ul>
        <li>Reserved Characters: Characters like <,>, and & are reserved in HTML</li>
        <li>Special Symbols: For symbols like ©, ®, or mathematical symbols.
        </li>
        <li>Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <span>If we want to tell someone in webpage that how paragraph tag looks like then we can't just simply write p with
        less than and greater than symbol . In such cases we use HTML Entities.</span>

    <p>This is a paragraph opening tag &lt;p&gt; and this is a paragraph closing tag &lt;/p&gt;.</p>
    <span>Few other examples of HTML Entities :-</span>
    <ul>
        <li> ampersand(lt); for < </li>
        <li> ampersand(gt); for ></li>
        <li> ampersand(amp); for &</li>
        <li> ampersand(nbsp); for a non-breaking space</li>
        <li> ampersand(copy); for ©</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pre Tag in HTML</h2>
    <span> All then things which we write under pre tag will be displayed the same way as written with all the spaces
        and lines.</span>
    <pre>
        This is pre tag

        <!-- all these lines will be printed as well -->

        This line is printed the same way it is written.
    </pre>

    <h2>Code Tag in HTML </h2>
    <p>In HTML there is a code tag under which we can write all the code (Code of c language, c++, java etc..).</p>
    <pre>

            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
            &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
            &lt;title>Code&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                
            &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
