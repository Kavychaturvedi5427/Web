        <dt>Id in HTML</dt>
        <dd>An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. It is often used
            for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations. No tag can have same id , and they can't have more than 1
            id. In css id's are targetted using "#" symbol.</dd>

        <dt>Classes in HTML</dt>
        <dd>The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way, you can easily change
            their look or behavior all at once. Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They
            are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.
            N number of tags can have same classes , and one tag can have multiple classes. In CSS classes are targeted using "." symbol.
