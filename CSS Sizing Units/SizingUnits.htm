            1:-- Unit "vw" : This unit is important as it makes the website responsive to different display sizes for example :- if we give 80vw then it mean it will display the content in  80% of the display in which we are opening the webpage. <br><br>
            2:-- Unit "em" :  Relative to the font size of the parent element. Eg: 5em means the size would be 5 times the current font size. This will inherit from the size of the parent element. For example :-- If we give container which is the parent of this paragraph the font-szie of 18px and then the font-size of this para as 1.2em then it will make the size of this para as 1.2 times 18px (the font-size of the parent). <br><br>
            3:-- Unit "rem" - Relative to the font size of the root element (i.e HTML).  For example :-- if we give the font size to the root element as 12px and then if we want our paragraph to has the font size of 2 times as that of the size of root element (i.e HTML) then in that case we use rem so that it become 2 times the font-size of the font size of the root element. <br><br>
